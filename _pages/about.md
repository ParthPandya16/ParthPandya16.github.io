Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team
======
CAVs Controls Junior Team Member
======
The Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team at Virginia Tech is a design team located in the Ware Lab. The team participates in the EcoCar Challenge, a four-year competition cycle. For this cycle, each team has been given a Cadillac Lyriq.

The CAVs subteam handles perception, controls, and integration software for the vehicle. This includes developing a Human-Machine interface, cybersecurity/command actuation, adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and sensor fusion. As a member of the CAVs subteam, I have developed an adaptive cruise control algorithm. Currently, I am working on lane centering for the Lyriq.
